## Want to translate my mods in your languages ?
🌐 🇲🇫 🇮🇹 🇩🇪 🇹🇷 🇸🇯 🇵🇸 🇨🇳 🇰🇷 ...   
Some mods are localizable and you can contribute to add your languages to my mods.
Only mods with a translations folder can contains translations *(or I need to add one, can be done if needed)*
Examples: src/ILoveSlicksters/translations

### Steps
- Launch the game with the mods activated
- Search the mod strings template (.pot file) in:  D:\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\strings_templates    
- Open and edit the file with [POedit](https://poedit.net/) or an [alternative](https://alternativeto.net/software/poedit/about/)
- Export it to .po
- Send me the file and tell me for which mod it is 
- Than I upload it on steam and everyone can access it
